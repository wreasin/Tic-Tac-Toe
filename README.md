# Tic Tac Toe Game
### Developed and modernized a popular game "Tic Tac Toe".

I’m really glad to share that,
___This Projects featured on prestigious newspaper [The Daily Star](https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/noticeboard/news/achievement-bubt-students-modernising-popular-game-3413216) and [JaiJaiDin](https://www.jaijaidinbd.com/todays-paper/homeland/392940).___     

___->___ Despite the game's widespread familiarity, the transition to its digital version presented various software and hardware challenges. The project was led by Our team "Team Error", and the successful implementation involved intricate circuit construction, microcontroller programming, and PCB design. This game offers two main modes –single-player and multiplayer. In single-player mode, one can compete against artificial intelligence, while multiplayer mode allows two players to play together. Touch sensors are used for input, and an Arduino Mega chip controls the entire game. The design incorporates multiple PCBs to facilitate future development and simplify troubleshooting. Our motive and objectives is to combine the nostalgia of classic games with modern technology.
